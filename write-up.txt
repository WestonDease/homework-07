SQL vs. NoSQL databases is a matter of established needs vs. constantly changing needs. SQL servers allow for vertical scaling, meaning that
when you increase the power of the computer, this directly affects the efficiency of the database. NoSQL however is horizontally scaling,
meaning that the load of work must be spread across more computers to increase efficiency. This is like breaking up something heavy into
lighter loads to make it easier. SQL's data structures require predefined structures to run. This means everything in the data structure has
to match the same protocol. NoSQL however works on an object by object basis and can adapt to many different keys for data. Due to the differences,
industries with set conventions and well documented, simple data is best suited for SQL while rapidly growing industries are best for NoSQL with features
like creating documents before defining their structure or changing fields as requested.
